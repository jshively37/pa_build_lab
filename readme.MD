# Deploy PA Lab

This git repo will be responsible for documentation, deploying, and configuring a PA lab in Azure.

End state will be deploy a PA in Azure, configure interfaces, deploy an app_server VM, and create a tunnel back to Strata Cloud Manager.

Phase one is focused on creating a living document that walk throughs the manual process.
